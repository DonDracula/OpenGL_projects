## Description：
Simulate the wind by using the Particle-Based (SPH) crashed with the wall. By using this, we want to show you that the wind flow is 
affected by the object, like the wall here. Then, we can use this method to simulate the wind flow around the string kite, and using 
sensor particles to reach a better effect.
